## Approach

My approach to curriculum development has a few key characteristics:

### Standards-Based

Traditional education programs focus on interesting content, assess how well the content was retained, and then hope that that knowledge will translate into useful skills. I develop curriculum around specific, measurable, industry-aligned standards that learners will be able to demonstrate. Assessments are aligned to those standards, and content is designed to develop fluency toward the assessments.

### Concrete Over Abstract

Many curriculum developers focus on theory and abstractions and hope that learners will be apply to apply them to specific situations. While I share the goal of developing transferrable knowledge and skills, cognitive science and empirical evidence point to concrete, authentic examples as being a more reliable route to get there. This means that concepts are taught in context and developed alongside practical skills.

### Emphasis On Practice

No amount of reading, watching, and talking can subsitute for hands-on practice. A distinguishing feature of my curricula is a blurred line between assessment, direct instruction, and lab work. For any particular skill or group of skills, there is ample opportunity for practice, feedback, and remediation. This occasionally means trading low-value "topic coverage" for high-value rigor on a smaller number of skills. The result is that learners are consistently building on a solid foundation, and learners and educators alike have higher confidence in what the learners know and can do.

## Deliverables

The curriculum I'm proposing has 5 deliverable elements:

### Assessments

For each of the standards, I will provide multiple rubriced assessments (delivered in as Git repositories). These are designed to be tightly-aligned to the standards, and represent authentic software development tasks. They're designed to be used in a low-stakes, multiple-attempts manner to provide opportunity for full coverage of the standard as well as opportunity for feedback, remediation, and high rigor.

### Exercises

Assessments are authentic tasks; exercises are exaggerated or contrived tasks designed to develop automaticity on critical and difficult skills. A full set of exercises (delivered as Git repositories) will be included for each of the most difficult and/or skills involved in each standard.

### Direct instruction materials

Great instruction is dynamic and responds to the immediate needs of specific learners. That's why instead of static lecture outlines, I rely on "triple plans." These include:

* A measurable/manageable/most important/made-first learning objective
* A way to measure whether each learner has met the objective in real-time
* A guide for what kinds of things teachers and students can during a syncronous instruction session to meet the objective

I will provide a set of these for all key topics (delivered as Markdown documents), with the expectation that instructors will combine, repurpose, and exclude them as their particular students and classes require.

### Self-learning materials

These will be custom-written content (in the form of Markdown documents), custom-recorded video lessons, and curated third-party materials. In a traditional curriculum, this would comprise the bulk of the deliverables. It has been my experience that students benefit far more from depth in the other three categories, and I intend for this work to reflect that prioritization as well. This also helps with longevity of the curriculum. Authentic assessments for technical topics age relatively well compared to topic content- the same assessments and exercises can often usefully survive through multiple revisions of content as technology changes.

## Out of scope

Some things that are explicitly out of scope for this proposal:

### LMS integration

The content I will provide is LMS-agnostic and should easily fit into any system. This proposal does not include selecting an LMS, loading content into it, or optimizing an LMS for these materials, it does not explicitly include any software systems or automation (although test automation may be included in some materials).

### School Operations

The assessments, exercises, and instructional materials are designed to be grouped into the units specified in the RFP and can be used flexibly within them. I will provide a suggested sequencing. This proposal does not include any counseling on admissions, grading, cut scores, dismissals, satisfactory academic performance, tuition, instructor hiring or training, or school culture development activities.

### Exclusivity

TradeCraft will be free to extend, modify, repurpose, and distribute any of the materials provided as it sees fit. I reserve the right to reuse any of these materials (minus any TradeCraft branding) in the future.

I don't have intentions of directly competing with TradeCraft or working with anyone who is, but I do offer personal and corporate training services. I intend to do my best work on these materials, and as such I would like to be able to reuse them in my own trainings as well.

## Curriculum Outline

### 101: Workshop

This is a one-day workshop where attendees (typically with limited technical background) develop a simple "MadLibs" game and get experience with some of the technologies they'll work with in the program.

#### Standards

* Build simple applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### 102: Prework

This is intended to provide students with the technical skills necessary to be productive on the first day of 201.

#### Standards

* Manage file systems on the command line
* Implement version control on a file system using git
* Explain the flow of execution in programs
* Analyze problems using a methodology

### 201: Traditional Frontend

The goal of this course is for students to be able to confidently build websites and simple web apps using core web technologies. By the end of this course, students should be able to work professionally doing basic website design and maintenance.

#### Standards

* Build websites using HTML and CSS
* Add interactivity to websites using JavaScript
* Integrate APIs into websites using JavaScript
* Deploy and publish websites

### 301: Modern Frontend

The goal of this course is for students to be able to work as modern frontend developers. They will develop the skills necessary to build single-page web applications using component-based architecture.

#### Standards

* Build static pages using React
* Build real-time filters using React
* Build forms using React
* Build owner/member pages using React
* Integrate routing into a single-page application
* Integrate state management into a single-page application
* Deploy and publish web applications

### 401: Backend

The goal of this course is to prepare someone for work as a backend or full-stack engineer. It focuses on API development, database design and management, and authentication/authorization.

#### Standards

* Build non-relational APIs
* Build relational APIs
* Query databases using SQL
* Deploy and publish web backends
* Develop APIs using unfamiliar technologies
* Build automated tests for APIs

### 501: Career

The goal of this course is to prepare someone for a technical job search. It covers applications, as well as technical and non-technical interviewing topics specific to technical jobs.

#### Standards

* Write resumes and cover letters for technical jobs
* Solve technical interviewing challenges
* Answer non-technical interviewing questions
