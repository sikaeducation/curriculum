# Mad Libs

This is an exercise that combines basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make a simple web application.

Mad Libs is a phrasal template word game. It consists of one player prompting others for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story before reading aloud.

## Instructions

### HTML

Make an HTML page that includes:

* A title
* A heading
* Inputs for entering each of the words in the MadLib
* A button for submitting the words you enter
* A section for displaying the text of the Mad Libs. Enter the fixed content in paragraph tags, and use output tags to display the entered words.

### CSS

Make a CSS file to style your HTML page. Some ideas:

* Change the fonts and other typographic properties
* Make the inputs and labels display on their own lines
* Set the maximum width of long lines to keep them from running across the whole screen
* Change the background color, text color, and border of the button
* Change the style of cursor when hovering over the button
* Modify the padding and margin of different elements to give everything some "breathing room" (remember, this works with the `<body>` element as well!

### JavaScript

Make a JavaScript file that contains a function. Inside of this function:

* Store the values the user enters in the input fields in variables
* Set the text of the `<output>` elements equal to what you stored in the relevant variable
* Call the function when the button is clicked

## Example Mad Lib

Here is an example MadLib that you can use, but feel free to get creative!
