# Design: Typography

## Why?

Typography might seem trivial, but it's actually one of the most critical parts of a design. The same words can look serious, playful, important, or relaxed based solely on the typography. Typography determines how easy your content is to read on the device it's being read on. It helps your readers understand what's important and what's extra, which helps them locate what they're looking for.

## What's Going On

First, let's differentiate between a typeface and a font:

Typeface: A family of fonts that share similar characteristics.
Font: A typeface at a specific weight, style (eg. italic) and size.

"Arial" is a typeface, "Arial 16px italic bold" is a font.

Next, let's differentiate between the major categories of typeface:

* Serif: These have little feet at the bottom of the characters, which helps readers' eyes follow along the line better. They also have a more "serious" personality.
* Sans-Serif: These don't have feet, and often render more cleanly on screens. They have a more "modern" personality.
* Monospace: In monospace type, whether a character is thin (eg. l) or wide (eg. M) it will take up the exact same amount of space. This is especially important in things like code, where lining up columns is important.
* Display: This is decorative type, often used in logos and headings. This communicates a lot of personality and has a lot of impact, but is usually not suitable for long-form reading.

Characteristics of type:

* Typeface
* Size
* Style
* Weight

## Gotchas

* Don't be clever- most type needs are well-served by doing what's popular.
* Easy on the reversed type

## History

In the days of the printing press, a type foundry would design a typeface, and then sell it to printers in the form of fonts. These were boxes full of stamps that could be used to "typeset" a piece of content. All of our current type vocabulary calls back to this tradition.
