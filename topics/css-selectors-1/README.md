## Why?

There are a lot of different ways to select elements in CSS, and they're not equal. Some of them have tradeoffs.

## Example

Both of these do the same thing:

```css
```

```css
```

However, this one gets accidentally overridden:

```css
```

## What's going on?

Basic selectors:

* ID
* Class
* Tag

## Gotchas

* Don't forget the . or #
* Specificity
* Efficiency
* No "ancestor" selector
