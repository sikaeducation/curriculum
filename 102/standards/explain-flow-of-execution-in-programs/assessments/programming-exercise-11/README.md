# Programming Exercise

Your task is to figure out how this code works.

* Come with a test input for the function.
* Trace the flow of the program with your test input **without running the code**, keeping track of all of the variables and transformations until you can determine the output.
* Keep coming up with new inputs until you're confident until you're confident that you know how the function works.
* Write a summary of what the function does.

```js
function (actualAge){
  if (actualAge == 1){
    return {
      humanYears: actualAge,
      catYears: 15,
      dogYears: 15,
    }
  }

  if (actualAge == 2){
    return {
      humanYears: actualAge,
      catYears: 24,
      dogYears: 24,
    }
  }

  return {
    humanYears: actualAge,
    catYears: (actualAge - 2) * 4 + 24,
    dogYears: (actualAge - 2) * 5 + 24,
  }
}
```

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
|       |        | 
|       |        | 
|       |        |

  </tr>

## Rubric

* Contains a plausible collection of test cases
* Outputs are accurately derived from inputs
* Summary is plausible
  * Official answer is that it takes a number of years, and returns an object containing what that number of years represents in human, cat, and dog years. Cats and dogs get 15 for their first year and 9 for their second year. Cats get 4 dog years per year after that, dogs get 5 dog years per year after that.
