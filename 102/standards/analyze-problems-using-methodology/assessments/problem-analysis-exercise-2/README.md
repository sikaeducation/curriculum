# Problem Analysis Exercise

Suppose you're in a hallway lined with 100 closed lockers. You begin by opening every locker. Then you close every second locker. Then you go to every third locker and open it (if it's closed) or close it (if it's open). Let's call this action toggling a locker. Continue toggling every nth locker on pass number n. After 100 passes, where you toggle only locker #100, how many lockers are open?

* Restate the problem in your own words as simply and clearly as possible. Use a visualization as appropriate.
* Identify the given data, the unknown, and the constraint
* Describe what makes the problem difficult to solve. In other words, why isn't the solution immediately obvious?
* Detail two different approaches to solving the problems.

Note that you do not need to solve the problem.

## Rubric

* Contains a clear and simple restatement of the problem that:
  * Identifies the data
    * 100 lockers, currently in a "closed" state
  * Identifies the unknown
    * The count of lockers that are in an "open" state
  * Identifies the constraint
    * There are 100 runs, each one targeting every nth locker where n is the number of the run
    * The lockers will be toggled between "closed" and "open" each run
* Identifies a plausible difficulty with the problem
* Details 2 plausible approaches to solving the problem
