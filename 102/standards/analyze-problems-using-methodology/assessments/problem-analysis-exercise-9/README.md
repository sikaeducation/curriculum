# Problem Analysis Exercise

Suppose a standard 8x8 chessboard has two diagonally opposite corners removed, leaving 62 squares. Is it possible to place 31 dominoes of size 2x1 so as to cover all of these squares?

---

* Restate the problem in your own words as simply and clearly as possible. Use a visualization as appropriate.
* Identify the given data, the unknown, and the constraint
* Describe what makes the problem difficult to solve. In other words, why isn't the solution immediately obvious?
* Detail two different approaches to solving the problems.

Note that you do not need to solve the problem.

## Rubric

* Contains a clear and simple restatement of the problem that:
  * Identifies the data
    * A 62-square grid, square but for 2 opposing corners that are empty
  * Identifies the unknown
    * Whether it's possible to place 31 2x1 tiles on the grid
  * Identifies the constraint
    * Tiles can't overlap
    * Every tile must be used
* Identifies a plausible difficulty with the problem
* Details 2 plausible approaches to solving the problem
