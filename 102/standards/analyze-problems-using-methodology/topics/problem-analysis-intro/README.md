# Intro to Problem Analysis

When you start programming your natural inclination will be to immediately start coding. You'd be well-served by exercising the discipline to analyze the problem first.

Computers aren't smart, they don't understand natural language, and they can't infer your intention. They can only understand what you want if you tell them very literally. On the other hand, human problems are rarely so neat and tidy. That means that we need to do a lot of interpretation before telling the computer what to do.

There is an excellent problem-solving methodology that can guide your thinking. Polya's 4-step problem-solving methodology is a battle-hardened tool for approaching and solve any computational problem. For now, focus on the first two steps of the methods: Understanding the problem and devising a plan.
