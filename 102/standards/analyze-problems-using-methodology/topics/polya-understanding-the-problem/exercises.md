## Parts of the Problem

For each of these, determine:

* What is the given data?
* What is unknown?
* What constraints are present?

Note that you are not required to actually solve the problem.

* How many ways can you change 1 dollar?
* Four campers, Adliya, Benjamin, Christine, and Dari, have just arrived at the Seeds of Peace Camp in Maine for an orientation session. Each will shake hands with all of the others. Draw a picture to illustrate this situation, and determine the number of handshakes.
* Bob has 10 pockets and 44 silver dollars. He wants to put his dollars in his pockets so distributed that each pocket contains a different number of dollars. Can he do so?
* Bob, Peter, and Paul travel together. Peter and Paul are good hikers; each walk `p` miles per hour. Bob has a bad foot and drives a small car in which two people can ride, but not three. The car covers `c` miles per hour. The three friends adopted the following scheme: They start together, Paul rides in the car with Bob, Peter walks. After a while, Bob drops Paul, who walks on. Bob returns to pick up Peter, and then Bob and Peter ride in the car till they overtake Paul. At this point, they change. Paul rides and Peter walks just as they started and the whole procedure is repeated as often as necessary. How much progress in miles does the company make per hour? Through which fraction of the travel time does the car carry just one man? Check the extreme cases `p = 0` and `p = c`.
* How can you get exactly 6 quarts of water from a river when you have only 4 quart and 9 quart buckets?

## Unsolvable Problems

These problems aren't solvable. Why?

* Among grandfather's papers, a bill was found: `72 turkeys $_67.9_`. The first and last digit of the number that obviously represented the total price of those fowls are replaced here by blanks, for they have faded and are now illegible. What are the two faded digits and what was the price of one turkey?
* A bear, starting from the point P, walked one mile due south. Then he changed direction and walked one mile due east. Then he turned again to the left and walked one mile due north, and arrived exactly at the point P he started from. What color was the bear?
* Bob wants a piece of land, exactly level, which has 4 boundary lines. Two boundary lines run exactly north-south, the two others exactly east-west, and each boundary line measures exactly 100 feet. Can Bob buy such a piece of land in the US?

## Visualizing Problems

Draw a picture or diagram that represents each of these:

* You make a 40ft long sub sandwich for a party. The sandwich is cut into 3 unequal pieces. The longest piece is three times as long as the middle piece, and the shortest piece if 5 feet shorter than the middle piece.
* Five liters of a 10% sugar solution are mixed with pure water to get a 5% solution.
* 6 people clink each other's classes in a toast.
* Messages are sent between three spies: Austin Powers, James Bond, and Chloe O'Brien.
* The Democratic, Republican, and Green political parties have no members in common.
* Assume that one group of students who are interested in physical fitness is taking Zumba classes and another is taking Pilates.
* Suppose a standard 8x8 chessboard has two diagonally opposite corners removed, leaving 62 squares. Is it possible to place 31 dominoes of size 2x1 so as to cover all of these squares?
* A solar panel is 3 times as long as it is wide.

## Sequence

Is the sequence of these operations important? Support your answer with examples.

* Square a number, add 5; Add 5 to a number, square the result
* Square two numbers, subtract the results; Subtract the reults, square the difference
* Add two numbers then divide by 3; Divide two numbers by 3 then add them together
* Multiple two numbers by 5 then add them together; Add two numbers together and then multiply the result by 5

## Veracity

Are these statements true? Support your answer with examples.

* Months of the year have 31 days
* (a / b) + (c / d) = (a + c) / (b + d)
* If a < b, then a + c < b + c
* If a < b, then a^2 < b^2
* x + y - z = x + z - y
* If the lengths of the sides of a square are doubled, then the area of the square is also doubled
* If a price is increased by 10% and then decreased by 10%, the price will be the same as the original price.
