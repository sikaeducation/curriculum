| Copy the diagram | Using an image of a stateful hierarchy (such a sequence of steps with previous/next buttons), identify the components and the stateful areas. |
| Identify the data and the data flow in the components | Observe, 5-10 minutes |
| Share with a partner | Observe |
| Share with the group | Facilitate |
| Identify the stateful parts of the hierarchy | Observe, 2-3 minutes |
| Share with a partner | Observe |
| Identify where the state is modified | Observe, 2-3 minutes |
| Share with a partner | Observe |
| Share with the class | Facilitate, guide toward a common design |
| Observe, take notes | Demonstrate how state changing functions are also passed through the hierarchy |
