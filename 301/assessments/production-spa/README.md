# Production SPA

## Features

### Multiple pages

Your app should feature multiple linked pages with meaningful content. They should be be appropriately visually designed. The page navigation should be managed with a routing library.

### API Integration

Your app should integrate with at least one third-party API. You should transform the data to make the format suitable for your site. API errors should be handled.

### Form

Your app should feature at least one form that collects user data. This data should be stored in the browser, and should have some integration with the data from your API. User data should be validated. `localStorage` may be used for local persistence.

### Application State

Your app should use some kind of application state. This state should be distributed through the app using an application state management technique.

## Definition of Done

Your site should have:

* A custom favicon
* A 404 page
* A commit history demonstrating that work was consistently saved
* Responsive styling
* A descriptive README explaining what the app is for, include at least one sample image of the app, and link to the deployed site

Additionally:

* The site should pass the [WebAIM's WAVE test](https://wave.webaim.org/) with no errors or contrast errors
* The HTML should pass the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

Finally:

* The site should be deployed to a public URL using a cloud provider
