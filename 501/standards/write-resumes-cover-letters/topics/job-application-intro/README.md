# Intro to Job Applications

## The Interview Process

The most common parts of the job application process are:

* [New Lead](#new-lead)
* [Application](#application)
* [Culture Screen](#culture-screen)
* [Technical Screen](#technical-screen)
* [Manager Interview](#manager-interview)
* [Offer](#offer)

Other than the lead and the offer, it's important to note that these steps don't occur in a fixed order. All of these scenarios are plausible:

* You interview first with the hiring manager, then do a technical screen with the rest of the team. At that point, you do a culture screen with HR, at which point you're asked to submit a formal application for their system.
* You start by applying for a job, at which point you are given a technical screen. Then, You go through a culture screen with HR, followed by an additional technical screen. Finally, you meet with the manager and get an offer in the same meeting.
* You do 2 culture screens, followed by 4 rounds of technical screens. Upon passing, you're invited to formally apply, at which point you're interviewed by a manager.

While these interview process have a high degree of variance in their sequencing, the underlying elements are usually similar and a common set of strategies can be applied to them.

## New Lead

To start the process, you need to generate leads. These can come from a lot of places:

* Referrals from people you know in the industry
* Companies people you know are applying to
* Former employers
* Recruiters
* Cold emails and LinkedIn promotions
* Company websites
* Tweets, blog posts or presentations by people at the company
* Networking events
* Technical roles in non-technical companies

If you're only looking for leads for new developers in high-visibility, easily searchable places, you will likely be let down. Generating high-quality leads takes a lot of work.

### Application

A job application generally has 3 components:

* A resume highlighting your skills and experience
* A cover letter pitching yourself for the job
* The application mechanism

The application mechanism can be as simple as an email and as complex as a multi-stage online application.

### Culture Screen

Culture screens, also called phone screens, are quick non-technical conversations. The purpose of them is to go beyond the resume and cover letter and assess whether the company should invest more time in interviewing you. These are usually done by a recruiter, and occasionally by a hiring manager or other team member.

These are the questions they're trying to answer:

* Do you have the skills you claim to have in your application?
* Are you a fit for the company's culture?
* Can the company afford you? Can the company lowball you?
* Do you have any important traits (positive or negative) that weren't in your application?
* Are you likely to accept an offer if they make one? Are you likely to stick around if you do?

These questions are also assessed at every stage of the process, but the culture screen is seen as a relatively inexpensive way to screen out applicants who look promising on paper, but have obvious problems that will prevent them from being successful later in the process.

### Technical Screen

Technical screens have the most variance. These are some common types of technical screen:

* Automated online coding tests
* In-person whiteboarding interviews, where you are given a problem and must work through it live in front of one of more people
* Portfolio reviews, where you present some of your work and talk through it
* Take-home challenges, where you're given a problem and asked to submit a solution after a period of time, usually a week
* Trivia, where you're asked to answer a series of technical questions

It's not unusual for a company to use a combination of these, or even have multiple rounds of the same type of technical screen. Other companies may use very limited technical screens or even none at all.

### Manager Interview

The manager interview is very similar to the culture screen, but is usually conducted by the hiring manager or even an executive at the company. Many of the questions will be the same or similar to those in the culture screen, but may involve more depth or follow-up questions. You may talk more specifically about compensation expectations, specific roles (if there are multiple roles they're considering you for), and long-term career goals. This interview may include an overview of the company's compensation strategy or even end in an offer or hiring decision.

### Offer

An offer consists of these elements:

* A title
* A start date
* A compensation package

If you don't have these, you don't have an offer yet. Especially with smaller companies, be careful about assuming that you've landed a job just because the people you've been interviewing with have been acting like you got it.

When you get an offer, there's still some work to do. You need to consider whether you'll accept the offer or attempt to negotiate it, and you need to weight it against other opportunities you've been interviewing for. You may be able to leverage the offer into speeding up your other application processes if there are some that you are especially interested in. You also need to weight the total value of the compensation package, including benefits. Especially for tech jobs, benefits can radically change the value of an offer.

Note that even when you get an offer, you can still pass if the job still isn't what you're looking for.

## Reflection

It's common to find yourself consistently getting stuck in one part of the process. For example:

* You can't generate any leads
* You throw a lot of applications out, but never get a response
* You get a lot of phone screens, but rarely get invited to do technical screens
* You consistently make it to final round of interviews, but haven't gotten an offer

This is normal. Consider it feedback from the market that something you're doing at the stage you're stuck at isn't working, and take it as an invitation to adjust your approach.

The most common feedback you'll get with any rejection is "We're looking for someone with more experience," which can become very disheartening. This is rarely true. This kind of rejection is called a polite no, and it just means you didn't pass that part of the interview.
