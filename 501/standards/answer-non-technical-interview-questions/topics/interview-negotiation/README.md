# Interviews: Negotiation

If someone makes you an offer and you say "can it be more?", the answer is likely "no."

Some tips on negotiation:

* The company's recruiter can be a useful resource in helping you gather information, including how flexible the salary or other perks are. Recruiters are often rewarded for successful hires, so they can be one of your best allies in closing the deal.
* You need to have a realistic perspective on what you're worth. Online tools like Glassdoor and Payscale can give you some of the picture, but they're very generic tools.
  * Talk to people in the industry about salaries, benefits and what people in your situation are making.
  * Identify any skills or knowledge you have such as your familiarity with the companies products or industry that might make you more valuable than a generic candidate
  * Find out if how closely the responsibilities and expectations of this job match the title. Titles like "Associate Developer", "Senior Engineer", and "Full-stack web developer" are ultimately arbitrary and have little alignment between companies.
* It's extremely unlikely that someone will rescind an offer because you try to negotiate. If you're polite and reasonable, the worst thing that will happen is they'll hold fast on their offer. If they've made you an offer, they'vde decided they like you enough to want to work with you. The only thing that will change their mind about that is you being rude or inconsiderate while negotiating.
* Contrary to popular wisdom, you don't have to be afraid of saying a number first. That said, any numbers you throw out anchor the rest of the negotiation, so you want the numbers to be:
  * Generous to yourself, because it's easier for you to negotiate down than up
  * Realistic enough that you won't be dismissed instantly
* Consider the total value of the compensation, because salary is only one factor. Some companies will pay 100% of your health insurance premiums, some will pay none. This can have a substantial difference in the value of an offer. While some things are likely to not be negotiable because they're the same for every employee, you may be able to find things that are more valuable to you than they are to the employer. For example, you may be able to push your start date back to give yourself a vacation before you start, or you may be able to negotiate a bonus or how flexible your hours are.
* If you don't get what you want in a negotiation, see if you can get the company to commit to reviewing your performance after 90 days.
