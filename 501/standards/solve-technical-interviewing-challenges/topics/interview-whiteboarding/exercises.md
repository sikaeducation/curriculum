Use the 4-step interview protocol on these problems. Remember to do them out loud in front of someone else. The problems are not especially difficult, but doing them with someone watching is the specific skill that you want to develop.

### 5 Gardens

Five friends have their gardens next to one another, where they grow three kinds of crops: fruits (apple, pear, nut, cherry), vegetables (carrot, parsley, gourd, onion) and flowers (aster, rose, tulip, lily).

* They grow 12 different varieties.
* Everybody grows exactly 4 different varieties
* Each variety is at least in one garden.
* Only one variety is in 4 gardens.
* Only in one garden are all 3 kinds of crops.
* Only in one garden are all 4 varieties of one kind of crops.
* Pears are only in the two border gardens.
* Paul's garden is in the middle with no lily.
* Aster grower doesn't grow vegetables.
* Rose grower doesn't grow parsley.
* Nuts grower has also gourd and parsley.
* In the first garden are apples and cherries.
* Only in two gardens are cherries.
* Sam has onions and cherries.
* Luke grows exactly two kinds of fruit.
* Tulips are only in two gardens.
* Apples are in a single garden.
* Only in one garden next to the Zick's is parsley.
* Sam's garden is not on the border.
* Hank grows neither vegetables nor asters.
* Paul has exactly three kinds of vegetable.

Who has which garden and what is grown where?

### Goat Cabbage and Wolf

A farmer returns from the market, where he bought a she-goat, a cabbage and a wolf (what a crazy market :-). On the way home he must cross a river. His boat is small and won't fit more than one of his purchases. He cannot leave the she-goat alone with the cabbage (because the she-goat would eat it), nor he can leave the she-goat alone with the wolf (because the she-goat would be eaten).

How can the farmer get everything on the other side in this puzzle?

## Reverse a String

Write a function named reverse that takes a string argument and returns the string reversed. `.reverse()` should not be used.

### Stable Employment Problem

We're going to solve an age-old problem that has plagued mountain villages and startups alike. Given two entities that have preferences for matching, how do you ensure that these matchups are "stable"? When we talk about stability, we mean that if two entities prefer each other over the partner they are matched with, the arrangement is not stable.

Given a list of developers, match them to companies. Match them such that no developer prefers a company that also prefers that developer over the one they are matched with. The "preferences" property represents an ordered list of preferences, with the first element being the most preferred.

```js
const developers = [{
  name: "Lilly",
  preferences : ["AirBnB", "Facebook", "Pivotal", "Amazon", "Lyft", "Uber"]
},{
  name: "Terrence",
  preferences : ["Lyft", "Facebook", "Pivotal", "AirBnB", "Amazon", "Uber"]
},{
  name: "Ken",
  preferences : ["Uber", "Amazon", "Facebook", "AirBnB", "Pivotal", "Lyft"]
},{
  name: "Zan",
  preferences : ["AirBnB", "Pivotal", "Facebook", "Amazon", "Lyft", "Uber"]
},{
  name: "Rebecca",
  preferences : ["AirBnB", "Lyft", "Uber", "Facebook", "Pivotal", "Amazon"]
}]

const companies = [{
  name: "AirBnB",
  preferences : ["Lilly", "Terrence", "Ken", "Zan", "Rebecca"]
},{
  name: "Facebook",
  preferences : ["Ken", "Lilly", "Terrence", "Zan", "Rebecca"]
},{
  name: "Pivotal",
  preferences : ["Terrence", "Zan", "Lilly", "Ken", "Rebecca"]
},{
  name: "Amazon",
  preferences : ["Rebecca", "Terrence", "Ken", "Zan", "Lilly"]
},{
  name: "Lyft",
  preferences : ["Rebecca", "Ken", "Zan", "Lilly", "Terrence"]
},{
  name: "Uber",
  preferences : ["Lilly", "Terrence", "Ken", "Zan", "Rebecca"]
}]
```

### Weird Words

Change every letter in a given string to the next letter in the alphabet. The function will take a single string as a parameter.

EXAMPLES:

* "Hello" --> "Ifmmp"
* "What is your name?" --> "Xibu jt zpvs obnf?"
* "zoo" --> "app"
* "zzZAaa" --> "aaABbb"

Note: Spaces and special characters should remain the same. Capital letters should transfer in the same way but remain capitilized.

### Apple Building

Input: Integer n
Output: String

Example:

`a(4)` prints as

```
   A   
  A A  
 A A A 
A     A
```

`a(8)` prints as

```
       A       
      A A      
     A   A     
    A     A    
   A A A A A   
  A         A  
 A           A 
A             A
```

`a(12)` prints as

```
           A           
          A A          
         A   A         
        A     A        
       A       A       
      A         A      
     A A A A A A A     
    A             A    
   A               A   
  A                 A  
 A                   A 
A                     A
```

Note:

* Each line's length is 2n - 1
* Each line should be concatenate by line break "\n"
* If n is less than 4, it should return ""
* If n is odd, a(n) = a(n - 1), eg a(5) == a(4); a(9) == a(8)

### Credit Card Mask

Usually when you buy something, you're asked whether your credit card number, phone number or answer to your most secret question is still correct. However, since someone could look over your shoulder, you don't want that shown on your screen. Instead, the credit card number is masked.

Your task is to write a function maskify, which changes all but the last four characters into '#'.

Examples:

```
maskify("4556364607935616") == "############5616"
maskify(     "64607935616") ==      "#######5616"
maskify(               "1") ==                "1"
maskify(                "") ==                 ""

# "What was the name of your first pet?"
maskify("Skippy")                                   == "##ippy"
maskify("Nananananananananananananananana Batman!") == "####################################man!"
```

### Date to Day

If I give you a date, can you tell me what day that date is? For example, December 8th, 2015 is a Tuesday.

Your job is to write the function `day(date)` which takes a string representation of a date as input, in the format 
`YYYYMMDD`. The example would be "20151208". The function needs to output the string representation of the day, so in this case "Tuesday".

Your function should be able to handle dates ranging from January 1st, 1582 (the year the Gregorian Calendar was introduced) to December 31st, 9999. You will not be given invalid dates. Remember to take leap years into account.

### Longest Sorted Distinct String

Take 2 strings including only letters from a to z. Return a new sorted string, the longest possible, containing distinct letters, - each taken only once - coming from s1 or s2.

Examples:

```py
a = "xyaabbbccccdefww"
b = "xxxxyyyyabklmopq"
longest(a, b) -> "abcdefklmopqwxy"

a = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
longest(a, a) -> "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
```
