# Production Full-Stack App

## Features

### Multiple pages

Your app should feature multiple linked pages with meaningful content. They should be be appropriately visually designed. The page navigation should be managed with a routing library.

### API Integration

Your app should be able to perform all CRUD actions from the user interface with at least two related models from a backend you wrote. User data should be validated on both sides. 3rd party APIs may be included.

### Auth

Your app should include some personalization through authentication. All passwords should be securely hashed. Trying to access a secure resource directly should result in redirection to a login page.

### Application State

Your app should use some kind of application state. This state should be distributed through the app using an application state management technique.

## Definition of Done

Your site should have:

* A custom favicon
* A 404 page
* A commit history demonstrating that work was consistently saved
* Responsive styling
* A descriptive README explaining what the app is for, include at least one sample image of the app, and link to the deployed site
* Redirection from protected routes

Additionally:

* The site should pass the [WebAIM's WAVE test](https://wave.webaim.org/) with no errors or contrast errors
* The HTML should pass the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

Finally:

* Both the front-end and back-end should be deployed to a public URL using a cloud provider
