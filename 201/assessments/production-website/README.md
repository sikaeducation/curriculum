# Production Website

## Features

### Multiple pages

Your website should feature multiple pages, linked together, each with meaningful content. They should be be appropriately visually designed.

### API Integration

Your website should integrate with at least one third-party API. You should transform the data to make the format suitable for your site. This data should be used to manipulate the DOM of the site. API errors should be handled.

### Form

Your website should feature at least one form that collects user data. This data should be stored in the browser, and should have some integration with the data from your API. User data should be validated.

## Definition of Done

Your site should have:

* A custom favicon
* A 404 page
* A commit history demonstrating that work was consistently saved
* Responsive styling
* A descriptive README explaining what the site is for, showing at least one sample image of the site, and linking to the deployed site

* The HTML should pass the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
