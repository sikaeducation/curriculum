# CSS: Selectors: Pseudo-Classes & Pseudo-Elements

You can select elements by tag name, class, and ID. You can select elements based on what parents they have, what siblings they have, and what attributes they have. There are a lot of ways to target elements, but how do you:

* Select the 4th occurrence of an element
* Add bullets, hyphens, and other decorations to elements
* Style links differently if they've been visited

To do those things, you need pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements.

## Pseudo-Classes

Pseudo-classes select elements that are in particular states:

```css
a:visited {
}
```

This selector targets any link that's already been visited by a user. Traditionally, an unvisited link is blue and a visited link is purple. This selector lets you customize those colors, as well as add any additional styles for those states. Links in particular have 3 pseudo-classes:

* **`:link`**: An unvisited link
* **`:visited`**: A visited link
* **`:active`**: A link that is currently being clicked

Another pseudo-class that will work on links or any other element is `:hover`, which is applied any time a cursor is hovering over an element. Note that this only works on devices like laptops that have mouses or trackpads.

Another type of pseudo-classes targets specific occurrences of an element. For example:

```css
.user:first-child {
}
```

This targets an element with a class of `user` that is the first child of its parent. For example:

```html
<ul>
  <li class="user">1</li>
  <li class="user">2</li>
  <li class="user">3</li>
</ul>
```

In this example, `.user:first-child` would target `1`, but not `2` or `3`. You can also target `2` with `.user:nth-child(2)`, or `3` with `.user:nth-child(3)`.

Other common pseudo-classes:

* `:last-child` - Targets an element that is the last child of its parent
* `:not(another-selector)` - Targets elements that doesn't also match another selector
* `:even` / `:odd` - Targets elements that are even or odd children of their parents. This is useful for striping a list or table.

```css
li:odd {
  background-color: hsl(240, 20%, 90%);
}
```

## Pseudo-Elements

Pseudo-elements target parts of elements that are not technically separate elements. For example:

```css
li + li::before {
}
```

This targets any `<li>` that immediate follows another `<li>`, and lets you apply styles to the space immediately before them. This is especially useful when combined with the `content` property:

```css
span + span::before {
  content: " - ";
}
```

This is used to add decorative content to elements. If you have a set of elements that like this:

```html
<div>
  <span>1</span>
  <span>2</span>
  <span>3</span>
</div>
```

These elements would ordinarily render as `123`. With the pseudo-elements, they instead render it as `1 - 2 - 3`. This strategy is preferrable for any kind of decoration that is purely visual and not semantic.

Other CSS pseudo-elements:

* **`::after`**: Targets the area after an element
* **`::first-letter`**: Targets the first letter of something, usually used to make a drop cap
* **`::first-line`**: Targets the first line of something, usually used in conjunction with small caps
* **`::selection`**: Targets content a user has highlighted

## Watch Out

An `a:hover` selector must come after `a:link` and `a:visited`, and `a:active` must come after `a:hover` in the CSS file in order to be work correctly.

---

When using the `:first-child`, `:last-child`, and `:nth-child` selectors, note that other elements that don't match the selector still count as children. So if the HTML is:

```html
<div>
  <p>1</p>
  <span>1</span>
  <section>1</section>

  <p>1</p>
  <span>1</span>
  <section>1</section>
</div>
```

`section:nth-child(2)` would return nothing, since the only `<section>` element is the 3rd child of its parent `<div>`. You can use `nth-of-type` to only count matches for the type you specify. `section:nth-of-type(2)` would return the second `<section>`
* When using `child` or `type` selectors, note that your selector is for the element you want, not the type of the parent
