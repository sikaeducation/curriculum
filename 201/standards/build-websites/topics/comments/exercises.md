Change the following code to use multiline comments:

```js
// This is a comment that goes
// On multiple lines and could
// Actually use a multiline comment instead
```

What's wrong with this code?

```css
.user-card {
  margin-left: -3px; // Visual alignment
}
```

Is this a valid HTML comment?

```html
<div>
  <!--
    Your code goes here
  -->
</div>
```

Is this a valid HTML comment?

```html
<img src="<!-- Image URL goes here-->" />
```
