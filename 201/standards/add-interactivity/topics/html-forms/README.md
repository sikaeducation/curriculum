# HTML: Forms

A key element of interactive web pages is users being able to input their own information. Semantically, a `<form>` denotes an area that a user will submit information. For example:

* Creating an account
* Logging in
* Setting preferences or configuration settings
* Giving feedback
* Sending a message

## Form Structure

Most HTML tags can be used in forms, but they primarily consist of different kinds of form inputs, including:

* `<input />`
* `<textarea>`
* `<select>`

There are also other elements that show up on forms less often, such as `<output>` and `<keygen>`.
