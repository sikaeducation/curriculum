Given this object:

```js
const pokemon = {
  name: "Pikachu"
  images: [{
    alt: "Pikachu strutting",
    url: "pokemon-images.com/pikachu-1.jpg",
  },{
    alt: "Pikachu dancing",
    url: "pokemon-images.com/pikachu-2.jpg",
  }],
}

How would you access the alt text of the first image?

What is the value of `pokemon.images[1].url`? What is its data type?

Convert these variables into an object:

```js
const productName = "Apple"
const productPrice = 0.79
const productManufacturer = "Dole"
```

Convert these variables into a nested object:

```js
const productName = "Apple"
const productPrice = 0.79
const productManufacturerName = "Dole"
const productManufacturerCountry = "USA"
```
