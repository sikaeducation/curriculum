# Intro to SQL

Sometimes you need to interact directly with the database. For example:

* Debugging a database without also running a web server
* Tuning a query to be more efficient than one generated by a query builder or ORM
* Working with embedded databases

The language for working directly with a database is SQL.

## SQL

SQL ("Structured Query Language") is a language for issuing commands to databases.

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM person;
```

Despite the name, SQL queries do more than read data. You can also add data:

```sql
INSERT INTO person (first_name, last_name)
VALUES ('Art', 'Blakey');
```

Update data:

```sql
UPDATE person
SET first_name = "Cannonball"
WHERE last_name = "Adderly";
```

and delete data:

```sql
DELETE FROM person
WHERE id = 13;
LIMIT 1;
```

Additionally, there are SQL queries that control the structure of databases:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE jazz;
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE person (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(255),
  last_name VARCHAR(255)
);
```

```sql
ALTER TABLE person 
ADD COLUMN birthday DATE;
```

SQL is a relatively small language (there are about 30 keywords in common use), but it can be used to do a lot of things.

## History

There are lots of different relational database platforms- PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, MariaDB, and many more. While there are some syntax and feature differences between them, they all support many of the exact same queries. This is because the syntax for SQL is standardized by ANSI.
