# SQL: LEFT JOIN

An `INNER JOIN` finds every column where there's a match. For example, to get all of a customer's orders you might write something like:

```sql
SELECT customer.*, order.*
FROM customer
INNER JOIN order on order.customer_id = customer.id;
```

There's a catch: If the customer doesn't have any orders, neither the order information nor customer information will display. For example, consider a user table and an agreement agreement table representing whether each user has agreed to a change in the terms of service. Only Bill Bellamy has agreed so far:

**customer**

| id | name |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Bill Bellamy |
| 2 | Kennedy Montgomery |
| 3 | Peter King |

**agreement**

| id | is_signed | customer_id |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | true | 1 |

If you try to list all of the customers and whether they've signed the agreement with an inner join, you may be surprised:

```sql
SELECT customer.name, order.product
FROM customer
INNER JOIN agreement ON agreement.customer_id = customer.id
```

| customer.name | order.product |
| --- | --- |
| Bill Bellamy | true |

`INNER JOIN` only returns results that have matches. If you want every customer whether or not there's a match, use `LEFT JOIN`:

```sql
SELECT customer.name, order.product
FROM customer
LEFT JOIN agreement ON customer.id = agreement.customer_id
```

| customer.name | order.product |
| --- | --- |
| Bill Bellamy | true |
| Kennedy Montgomery | |
| Peter King | |

`LEFT JOIN` will include everyone right in the first ("left") column in the join clause, even if there's not match in the second column.

## Watch Out!

`RIGHT JOIN` does the same thing as a `LEFT JOIN` but tolerates absences in the second column instead of the first. You can often rewrite a query to use on or the other, but use whichever one makes your query easier to follow.
