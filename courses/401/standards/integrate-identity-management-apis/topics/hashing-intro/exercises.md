### The Bomb and the General

In pairs:

You are in a room with an open door. The room you are in is a nuclear bunker with a computer that controls a nuclear detonation. It is your task to detonate the bomb on command ONLY if commanded to by the Army General Commander Chief and nobody else. You are allowed to discuss a plan with the Army General Commander Chief on the other side of the door before the door closes. After the door closes, you have no more contact with the outside world for the rest of your life. You are only allowed to get messages via a printer in your room. How do you ensure the message is from the Army General Commander Chief and not from someone masquarading as her?
