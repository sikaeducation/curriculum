# SQL Playground

This playground is for exploring sql queries.

- In terminal, open psql
- Copy and paste the code from any of the .sql files and review the output that you see.
- Alternatively, you can type the lines in yourself and step through it so you can see what is happening step by step
- Try some new things to help deepen your understanding of what is happening with the queries
- Are the results from the queries what you expect? Why or why not? What can you try to help you understand what is happening.
