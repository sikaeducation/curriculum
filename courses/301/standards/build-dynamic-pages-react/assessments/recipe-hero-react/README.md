# Recipe Hero

![Recipe Hero example](recipe-hero.jpg)

Refactor the HTML and CSS in `src/App.js` to use components and dynamically filter data.

* Your solution should have over 7 components
* Replace all hard-coded data with dynamically fetched data from the `recipes.json` file in the `public` folder
* The ingredients should be generated dynamically
* As ingredients are added from the list, the list of available recipes should filter in real time
* Recipe step navigation should be functional
* There should be a default message displayed if no recipes match the selected ingredients
