        Shoes. Everybody wants them. The problem is, no one can figure out where to buy them!
        That's why we created Sika Shoes. All you need to do is get the key from Gary, go down
        to the basement, unlock the door, plug in the computer, and order some shoes. Let's
        get shoes on our feet!
