# Programming: Math

Most of the math operators commonly used in programming are self-explanatory.

```js
1 + 1 // 2
2 - 1 // 1
3 * 3 // 9
4 / 2 // 2
```

Note that multiplication is typically done with the `*` symbol, not `x`.

There are two additional math symbols that are commonly used and bear more explanation.

## Exponentiation

To raise something to an exponent, use `**` twice. So, `2Â³` would be written:

```js
2**3 === 8 // true
```

## Modulo

The modulo operator (`%`) gives you the remainder of a division operation. For example, 4 does not divide into 3 evenly- there is a remainder of 1. So, `4 % 3` is 1. Some other examples:

```js
4 % 2 === 0
8 % 3 === 2
7 % 7 === 0
3 % 2 === 1
```

This seemingly-obscure operator has a few uses, but the most common one is telling whether something is even/odd, doing something every third item, and so on.

```js
const someNumber = 42

if (someNumber % 2 === 0){ // An even number is one that divides evenly into 2
  console.log("It's even!")
} else {
  console.log("It's odd!")
}
```

## Watch Out!

* You can only do math with numbers. This also means you can't do math with strings that look like numbers, like `"3" + "2"`.
