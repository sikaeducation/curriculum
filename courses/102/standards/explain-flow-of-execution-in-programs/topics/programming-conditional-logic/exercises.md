Identify what's wrong with the following code:

```js
if (phoneNumber.length = 10){
  // Code to run if true
}
```

---

Reverse the order of these so that the ideal case is last:

```js
if (phoneNumber.length === 10){
  console.log("Calling you now!")
} else {
  console.log("Please enter a 10 digit phone_number.")
}
```
