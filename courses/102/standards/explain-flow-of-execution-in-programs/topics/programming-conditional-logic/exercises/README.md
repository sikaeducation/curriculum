# Programming: Conditional Logic: Exercises

## Questions

* What kind of data is given to an `if` statement?
* What does the expression passed to an `if` statement determine?
* How do you specify an alternative to run if the expression passed to `if` statement is false?
* Can you have more than one alternative in an `if` statement?
* How do you specify multiple alternatives in an `if` statement?

## Activities

Identify what's wrong with the following code:

```js
if (phoneNumber.length = 10){
  // Code to run if true
}
```

---

Reverse the order of these so that the ideal case is last:

```js
if (phoneNumber.length === 10){
  console.log("Calling you now!")
} else {
  console.log("Please enter a 10 digit phone_number.")
}
```
