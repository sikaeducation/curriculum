# Programming: Boolean Logic 2: Comparisons: Exercises

## Questions

* What does the `===` comparison do?
* What does the `<=` comparison do?
* What does the `>` comparison do?
* Which of these is correct, `>=` or `<=`?
* What does `!==` comparison do?

## Activities

Simplify these logic expressions:

* `(5 === 5 && 5 < 3) || ("Hello, world!" || !true) = true`

```js
const someArray = [] 
const someOtherArray = ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"]
const message = "H"
const isActive = true
(someArray.length === 5 && someOtherArray.length < 3) || (message || !isActive)
```
