# Problem Analysis Exercise

Bob, Peter, and Paul travel together. Peter and Paul are good hikers; each walk `p` miles per hour. Bob has a bad foot and drives a small car in which two people can ride, but not three. The car covers `c` miles per hour. The three friends adopted the following scheme: They start together, Paul rides in the car with Bob, Peter walks. After a while, Bob drops Paul, who walks on. Bob returns to pick up Peter, and then Bob and Peter ride in the car till they overtake Paul. At this point, they change. Paul rides and Peter walks just as they started and the whole procedure is repeated as often as necessary. How much progress in miles does the company make per hour? Through which fraction of the travel time does the car carry just one man? Check the extreme cases `p = 0` and `p = c`.

* Restate the problem in your own words as simply and clearly as possible. Use a visualization as appropriate. Identify the given data, the unknown, and the constraint
* Describe what makes the problem difficult to solve. In other words, why isn't the solution immediately obvious?
* Detail two different approaches to solving the problems.

Note that you do not need to solve the problem.

## Rubric

* Contains a clear and simple restatement of the problem that:
  * Identifies the data
    * Peter and Paul move `p` miles per hour
    * Bob moves `c` miles per hour
  * Identifies the unknown
    * How much progress does the entire company make per hour
    * What proportion of the time does the car contain one person
  * Identifies the constraint
    * Bob can only carry either Peter, Paul, or neither, but not both
    * When Bob drops someone off, he drives back and that person keeps hiking
    * When Bob and a passenger overtake the remaining hiker, Bob drops off the passenger and picks up the hiker.
* Identifies a plausible difficulty with the problem
* Details 2 plausible approaches to solving the problem
