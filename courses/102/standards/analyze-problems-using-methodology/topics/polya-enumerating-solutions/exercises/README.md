# Polya's Problem-Solving Method: Devising a Plan: Exercises

## Questions

* How is understanding the problem distinct from devising the plan?
* What does DAVE stand for?
* What benefits do you get from just guessing an answer and seeing if you're right?
* What does it mean to make a model as part of devising a plan?
* What is a tree diagram? What kinds of problems are they well-suited to?
* Describe two examples of making a problem more specific.
* Describe two examples of making a problem more general.
* What is a special case of a problem?

## Activities

### List and Diagram

Draw a picture or diagram that visualizes an approach to solving these problems. Note that your visualization may incidentally solve the problem, but that's not a requirement.

* List the different combinations of heads and tails that are possible when a penny and a nickel are flipped.
* Use the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 to make as many ordered pairs as you can. For example, (1, 3) is a pair, as is (3, 1). Repeats are allowed, so (1, 1) counts as a pair.
* How many ways can two different 6-sided dice be rolled?
* How many ways can a 4-sided die and a 12-sided die be rolled?

### Simplify

Come up with simpler versions of these problems that may yield useful insights in the original problem:

* 10 people are being honored for their work. How many different ways can you line them up to take a picture?
* If you guess at 10 true/false questions, how many different ways can you fill out the 10 answers?
* Using all the letters of the alphabet, how many two letter codes can you form if you're allowed to use the same letter twice and the order of the letters is significant?
* A family has 7 children, some of whom have black hair, some of whom have red hair. If you list them (eg. `bbrbrrb`), how many lists are possible?
* A car comes with 7 options: upgraded tires, front heated seats, polished rims, front parking sensor, carbon interior trim, fender shields, and custom seat covers. You can buy the car with any combination of these, including none. How many possibilities are there?

### Problems

Come up with at least two different approaches to solving this problem. Note that you don't actually need to solve the problem, just enumerate at least two possible approaches.

* The local government wants to preserve two buildings. The combined age of the buildings is 451 years. If one building is twice as old as the other, what are the ages of the two buildings?
* You worked 15 hours last week. One job as a clerk in a sporting goods store paid you $7.25 an hour, and your job teaching guitar paid $12 an hour. If you earned $137.25 between the two jobs, how many hours did you work at each job?
* Last season, you carried the football 2 times more than your friend Steve, and 68 times less than your friend Jack. If all 3 of you carried the ball 1,110 times, how many times did each carry the ball?
* Two baseball players, Lisa and May, had a total of 295 runs batted in. If Lisa had 7 more than May, how many did each have?
* To number the pages of a bulky volume, the printer used 2989 digits. How many pages has the volume?
* Given a regular hexagon and a point in its plane, draw a straight line through the given point that divides the given hexagaon into two parts of equal area.
