Bob, Peter, and Paul travel together. Peter and Paul are good hikers; each walk `p` miles per hour. Bob has a bad foot and drives a small car in which two people can ride, but not three. The car covers `c` miles per hour. The three friends adopted the following scheme: They start together, Paul rides in the car with Bob, Peter walks. After a while, Bob drops Paul, who walks on. Bob returns to pick up Peter, and then Bob and Peter ride in the car till they overtake Paul. At this point, they change. Paul rides and Peter walks just as they started and the whole procedure is repeated as often as necessary. How much progress in miles does the company make per hour? Through which fraction of the travel time does the car carry just one man? Check the extreme cases `p = 0` and `p = c`.
