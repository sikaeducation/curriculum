# Polya's Problem-Solving Method: Devising a Plan

## Execute Questions

* Are you making progress?
* Have you solved the problem? Met all of the conditions?
* What am you positive about?
* What do you think is likely?
* Are you doing something you've already tried?
* Did you use all the data? Did you need to?

## Reflect Questions

* Does this solution indicate a more general rule?
* Are there counter-examples at the extremes?
* Does the answer make sense?
* Could you use this method to solve other problems?
* Can you derive the same answer a different way?

## Strategies For Finding Solutions

When looking for ways to design your solution, remember DAVE:

### Deduce

* Can you eliminate some possibilities?
* Guess and check
  * Is the answer right? Can you figure out how to get to it?
  * Is the answer wrong? In what ways?
  * Are you noticing patterns?
* Can you work backwards from the solution? How does the data become the unknown?
* Are there any patterns present?
* Are any parts of the problem interchangeable?

### Associate

* Can it be translated into an equation or formula?
* Can you make an analogy?
* Are any parts of the problem similar to other kinds of problems?
  * Could you use their unknowns?
  * Could you use their constraints?
  * Could you use their data?
  * Could you use their solutions?
  * Could you use their methods? 

### Visualize

* Draw a picture
  * Do some parts need to be emphasized?
    * Does it need different kinds of lines (solid, dotted, dashed)?
    * Should it use multiple colors?
  * Should it be 2D or 3D?
* Can you make a list?
* Can you make a table?
* Can you make a chart?
* Can you make a tree diagram?
* Can you make a model?

### Ease-In

* Solve an easier problem
  * What if you didn't have to solve part of the problem? Can you remove one of the constraints?
  * What if you assume something you suspect to be true but can't prove yet? Can you add a piece of data?
  * Can you build something that would help solve the problem?
  * Could you change any part of the problem to make it easier? Could you make the start closer to the end?
* Change the number of parts
  * Combine: Can you combine parts of the problem into one whole?
  * Decompose: Can you split the problem into multiple parts?
* Change the scope
  * Can you make it more concrete?
  * Can you make it more general?

## Evaluating solutions

* Can you check the answer using this strategy? Does it solve it?
* Does it handle special cases?
* Did you use all of the data you were given? Did you need to?
* Is it efficient?
* Do you think you can implement it?
