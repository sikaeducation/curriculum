# Polya's Problem-Solving Method: Devising a Plan

The second step of Polya's problem-solving method is to devise a plan to solve the problem. Note that this is distinct from actually solving the problem; all you're doing at this stage is thinking of ways the problem could be solved. Not all questions will relevant to all problems, but even seemingly irrelevant questions may yield useful insights.

## Strategies For Finding Solutions

When looking for ways to design a solution, use the DAVE questions:

### Deduce

* Can you eliminate some possibilities?
* You can just guess an answer?
  * Is the answer right? Can you figure out how to get to it?
  * Is the answer wrong? In what ways? How close was it?
  * Are you noticing patterns?
* Can you work backwards from the solution? How does the data become the unknown?
* Are there any patterns present?
* Are any parts of the problem interchangeable?

### Associate

* Can it be translated into an equation or formula?
* Are any parts of the problem similar to other kinds of problems?
  * Could you use their unknowns?
  * Could you use their constraints?
  * Could you use their data?
  * Could you use their solutions?
  * Could you use their methods? 

### Visualize

* Can you make a list?
* Can you make a table?
* Can you make a chart?
* Can you make a tree diagram?
* Can you make a model?
* Draw a picture
  * Does it help emphasize some parts?
  * Does it need different kinds of lines (solid, dotted, dashed)?
  * Should it use multiple colors?
  * Should it be 2D or 3D?

### Ease-In

* Solve an easier problem
  * What if you didn't have to solve part of the problem? Can you remove one of the constraints?
  * What if you assume something you suspect to be true but can't prove yet? Can you add a piece of data?
  * Can you build something that would help solve the problem?
  * Could you change any part of the problem to make it easier? Could you make the start closer to the end?
* Change the number of parts
  * Combine: Can you combine parts of the problem into one whole?
  * Decompose: Can you split the problem into multiple parts?
* Change the scope
  * Can you make it more specific?
  * Can you make it more general?

## Evaluating solutions

If you think you've crafted an approach, these questions will help you assess its viability:

* Can you check the answer using this strategy? Does it solve it?
* Does it handle special cases?
* Did you use all of the data you were given? Did you need to?
* Is it efficient?
* Do you think you can implement it?
