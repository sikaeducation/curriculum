# Polya's Problem-Solving Method: Understanding the Problem

## Strategies

### Identify

* What are the unknown parts of the problem?
* What is the unknown? What are the data? What is the condition?
* Are you being asked to find something or prove something?
* What are you asked to find or show?
* Can you separate out the data, the unknown, and conditions?
* Is all of the information relevant?
* Are there special cases?
* Do you understand all of the words in the problem? Is there any special terminology you need to distinguish?

### Understand

* Can you restate the problem?
  * How many different ways can you do it?
* Can you think of what the opposite of this problem is?
* Can you visualize the problem as a whole?
* Can you make an input/output table?
* Can you think of a picture or diagram that might help you understand the problem?
* Have you seen a problem like this before?
  * What's different about it?
  * Can we use the same solution?
  * Is the similarity biasing you?
* Is there an analogy for this problem?
* Are there parts of the condition that can be separated out?
* Is there a notation you can use to rewrite the problem?
* If you simplify parts of the problem, how much precision do you lose?
* Can you stretch the parameters to absurd lengths?
* Is the sequence things happen in important?
* Can you think of a more specific example of this problem?

### Judge

* Are any parts of the problem redundant?
* Are any parts of the problem contradictory?
* Is the problem solvable with the available information?
* What else would be useful to know?
