# Intro to Problem Analysis

When you start programming, your natural inclination will be to immediately start coding. You'd be well-served by exercising the discipline to analyze the problem first.

Computers aren't smart. They don't understand natural language. They can't infer your intention. They can only understand you want if you tell them in the most literal way possible. Our problems, on the other hand, are rarely so neat and tidy. That means that we need to do a lot of interpretation before we can tell the computer what to do.

Luckily, there is an excellent problem-solving methodology that can guide your thinking. Polya's 4-step problem-solving methodology is a battle-hardened tool for figuring out how to approach and solve any computational problem. For now, focus on the first two steps of the methods: Understanding the problem and devising a plan.
