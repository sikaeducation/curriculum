## Git Basics Warmup

**Diagram Git / GitHub workflow**

1. Workflow for starting a new project: Provide a brief walk through of what steps you take when you initialize a local repo, do some work and push it to a GitHub repo.
  - Guiding questions:
    - How does Git know to start tracking changes you make to your project?
    - How does Git know where to push your repo to?
1. Workflow for forking: Provide a brief walk through of the steps you take when you fork a repo, bring it down to your local machine, make some changes and push it up to GitHub.
  - Guiding questions:
    - Does the owner of the forked repo know anything about the changes you make to your forked copy? If so, how?
    - When you fork a repo how do you connect a remote so you can push to GItHub?

## Team Feature Branching

* Working with everyone at your group:
        * Fork and clone this repo
    * Create a branch for coordinating your group
        * Make a valid `index.html` file
        * Everyone should make a new feature branch for themselves
        * Everyone should add a new HTML page in the `pages` folder in that feature branch
        * Add a link to it in the `index.html` file
        * Merge all of the feature-branches from your table into your coordinating branch
        * Resolve any conflicts
    * Everyone should pull request back to this repo with all of their teammates pages and links

Note that you will have to communicate a lot to do this well!
