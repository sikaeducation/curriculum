# Interviewing: Take-Home Challenges

A common part of interviewing for a technical job is a take-home challenge. Take-home challenges vary, but they generally involve building an app or feature on your own over a period of time. They were originally conceived as an alternative to whiteboarding, which many candidates found intimidating and an unrealistic measure of their programming ability. They come with their own drawbacks and considerations.

## What A Take-Home Challenge Shows

Here's what you want to demonstrate with a take-home challenges:

* Above all, can you follow directions? The instructions on a take-home challenge often feature a lot of nuance that is easy to miss. Read the instructions very carefully and identify anything that's ambiguous or could be interpretted multiple ways. If any part of what you're being asked to do is unclear, reach out for clarification quickly. The worst thing you can do is come up with an elegant solution to the wrong problem.
* Write your cleanest code. It's cheap to say you're "detail-oriented"; this is your chance to demonstrate it. You should have flawless indentation and code style, descriptive variable names, refactored code, tests, a thoughtful README, and meaningful commits. It's better to shine in these areas than solve the problem.

## How Long You Should Spend

Employers will often specify either how long they expect the challenge to take or how long they want you to spend on it. This is controversial. Some things to consider:

* Employers consistently underestimate how long a take-home challenge will take. This may make you feel bad when you're unable to complete it in the estimated time.
* Other applicants may either ignore a given time limit or lie about how long they took.
* Alternatively, companies may explicitly be looking for people trying to be dishonest about how long they took.
* Long take-home challenges can perpetuate inequities by privileging people who have the additional time to do them.

Ultimately, you need to decide how you feel about take-home challenges and how you want to approach them. As a baseline, stick to the given time estimate or time limit. If you're not done with the challenge, tell the employer how much time you've spent and send them your work. Ask them if they'd like you to take additional time to continue working on it.
