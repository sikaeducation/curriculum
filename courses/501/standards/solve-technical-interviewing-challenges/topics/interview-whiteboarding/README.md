# Interviewing: Whiteboarding

Whiteboarding is an intimidating part of interviewing, but it's ultimately a learnable skill. Practice using this 4-step whiteboarding protocol:

## 4-Step Whiteboarding Protocol

### Clarify the problem

Start by restating the problem in your own words. This does two things: It clarifies that you understand what you're being asked to do, and it buys you time to think about the problem more.

Next, try to extract the useful pieces of data from the prompt. What are the inputs? What are the outputs? What are the contraints? Write these on the board.

Next, draw an input/output table. The trick to this is that you want to cover a reasonable number of cases, but you also want them to be relatively fast to verify.

### Enumerate Possible Approaches

Now that you understand the problem, think through different approaches. Consider:

* Any obvious solutions
* Solutions that take advantage of particular language features
* Different paradigms (functional, object-oriented, procedural)

Try to come up with at least two solutions, and pick the most promising one. "Promising" doesn't necessarily mean most elegant or most efficient; its perfectly reasonable to select an approach because it's the only one you're confident you can do under pressure.

### Work the Problem

Start by writing "sandwich code"- name the function, write out the inputs, write out what the outputs will be.

Next, don't try to write syntactically correct code. What you're aiming for is "pseudo-code", or code that identifies all the logical steps one would need to follow without prescribing any one language.

More than any other step, it is imperative that you narrate what you're doing the entire time. As you're working through the solution, note that it's OK to discover new problems (and go back through this process to solve them). Additionally, it's OK to make mistakes or have to double back.

### Reflect

When you think you've solved the problem, go back to your input/output table from step 1. Run each input through your pseudocode, out loud, and verify that it produces the expected result. It's common to identify problems with your solution during this step, especially around off-by-one errors and comparisons. That's much better than not finding them at all.

If you've validated your solution, start talking about how it could be improved. Are there inelegant parts of the code? Problems with scaling? Problems with speed? Talk about the trade-offs the code will have.

If your solution doesn't work, identify why. What would need to be true for your solution to work?

## Practice

Reading and recalling these steps is not enough to become a good whiteboarder. Whiteboarding is an independent skill from programming, and the only way to get good at it is practicing. In particular, you need to practice out loud in front of another person. It will likely feel embarassing or awkward, but it's much better to get past that stage with a partner than have to develop these skills when an actual job is on the line.
