# Interviewing: Trivia

## Why people ask trivia questions

Trivia questions are used for two reasons:

* To reject people whose resume exaggerated their knowledge
* To find out relative strengths and weaknesses

## What kinds of trivia questions get asked

The best answer to this question is to look them up on the internet; there's a reasonable chance that the person interviewing you is doing the exact same thing, and may even ask you the same questions you find.

Beyond that, these kinds of questions are common:

### Smoke Tests

These questions are often used early on to weed out fakers. Technology jobs pay well and require few (if any) credentials, so sometimes people try to fake their way through interviews and hope they'll learn on the job. Additionally, some people have a lot of credentials and no practical skills. For example:

* What is a string?
* What is a variable?

### Conceptual Questions

These are language-agnostic questions about concepts. For example:

* What is a closure?
* What is character encoding?
* What is polymorphism?
* Describe HTTP

### Language/Framework Questions

These are language- or framework-specific questions that are trying to determine your comfort level with the tool. For example:

* What is the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript?
* What's the difference between a hash and an object in Ruby?
* What's the difference between function declarations, function expressions, and arrow functions in JavaScript?

## Answering a question you don't know the answer to

If you don't know the answer to a question, don't just say "I don't know."

1. Admit you're not sure about the answer
2. Try to pull out any words or concepts that you recognize and create connections to them
3. Ask for help
4. Optionally, ask if you can look it up

For example, if you don't know the answer to "What is inheritance?", you could respond:

>"I'm not sure, but I can infer from the name it's about getting something from somewhere else, a parent maybe? Am I in the ballpark?"

You can use this as a springboard for a conversation or an opportunity to learn. Things your interviewer says may also trigger your memory for times you have used or seen the concept being discussed.
