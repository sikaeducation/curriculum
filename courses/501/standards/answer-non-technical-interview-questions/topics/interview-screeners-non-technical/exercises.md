With a partner, use the STAR technique to answer these questions:

* Tell me about a time when you made a mistake.
* Tell me about a time when you had a conflict with a coworker.
* Tell me about a project you enjoyed working on.
* Tell me about a time when you overcame adversity.
* Tell me about a project you're proud of.

With a partner, practice answering the question "Tell me about yourself." Ask your partner to give you feedback, and then repeat the exercise until you're confident in your answer.
