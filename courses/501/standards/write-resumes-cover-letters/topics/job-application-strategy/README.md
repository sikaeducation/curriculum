# Applications: Strategy

Getting a job in tech is takes a long time and is emotionally exhausting. It helps to be organized.

## The Job Funnel From An Employer's Perspective

An employer would generally prefer to hire from these sources, in this order:

1. Internal transfer. They already know and trust the person, and just need to move them into a new role.
2. Internal referral. The person has already been vetted by someone they know and trust.
3. Internal recruiter. The company is already paying for an internal recruiter, and is relying on their expertise to locate the best people for their roles.
4. Closed job posting. These are job postings to smaller communities, such as meetups or local job boards, or just listings on the company's website. The company usually doesn't have to pay for them, and can often target a particular audience.
5. External recruiter. These are recruiters outside the company who take a fee for finding and vetting candidates.
6. Open job posting. These are job postings, usually paid, on large public boards like Monster or Indeed. The effort for applying to these is lowest, so the candidate quality is usually lowest too.

One of the most common issues you'll come across in a job search is none of the open postings are looking for developers without experience. While the job search is definitely hardest for new developers, a lack of open postings doesn't actually reflect any kind of absence of opportunity. Rather, it means that most companies are already able to easily fill those roles using one of the first 3 options, so they usually only resort to the last 3 options if they're desperate.

## Types of Application

### Cold Applications

A cold application is when you see a job posting and apply to it. This is the least effective way to find a new job because your hit rate will be very low, but it occasionally works and should be a part of your job search strategy. Some tips:

* LinkedIn's "Easy Apply" feature is one of the easiest and most efficacious ways to cold-apply to jobs. These can be as easy as clicking a button.
* Don't be put off by experience or education requirements in a job posting. If you'd like to do the job, apply for it. Remember, it's never your job to filter yourself out.
* Look for opportunities to "warm up" your application by connecting with someone who already works there at a networking event.
* Just because they're cold applications, you should still put some effort into writing a tailored resume and cover letter. Look at them as opportunities to get faster at learning about companies and to try new things and hone your pitch.

### Warm Applications

Warm applications are one where you know someone at the company. The person doesn't need to a former coworker or childhood friend-- they can be someone you met at a meetup or had a conversation with online. This can give you a name to reference in a cover letter, turn into an introduction to a recruiter or hiring manager, or otherwise be a valuable source of information about the company and the position. There's an old adage that if you ask for a job you'll get advice, and if you ask for advice you'll get a job. Frame your conversation in terms of what you'd like to learn and you'll have better results than if you just beg strangers for jobs.

### Recruitment

Recruitment is when a company recruiter finds you and asks you to apply to the company. This is a good thing, but note that it's not always a guarantee that you'll even get an interview. Recruiters are expected to generate a lot of applications. It's possible that they read all about you, checked out your portfolio, and decided that you're a great match for the company. It's also possible they found a keyword on your LinkedIn profile that matched something they were looking for and asked you to apply.

There are two ways to stand out

### Referrals

The easiest way to get a referral is if you already know someone at the company. If you don't already know someone, here are some ways to meet them:

* Network with software developers at non-tech events. Even if someone can't speak to your technical skills but knows you were a reliable and hard-working softball teammate, they may refer you.
* Speak at meetups. Meetups are always looking for speakers, even from newer developers. The industry is always changing, and you don't need to be an expert to know something that someone else doesn't yet. This is a great chance to advertise yourself to recruiters and other developers.
* Help other developers and recruiters find who they're looking for. This is the most underused strategy for ingratiating yourself to recruiters and developers. If you talk to enough people, you'll find opportunities to connect them with each other. If you know a senior developer who is looking for a new role and you can introduce them to someone who's looking for a new tech lead, you now have two people who want.

## Managing Your Applications

As you're applying for jobs, you need to stay organized. For each application, keep track of:

* The name of the company
* The details of the job you applied for (better to copy/paste them in the case the posting gets taken down)
* What you've learned about the company
* The names of anyone you know or have interacted with there, what you talked about, and when you talked to them
* The status of the application- Lead, applied, in-process, rejected, and offer.

If you're following up on something you were asked to do, try to get back in a day. If they haven't gotten back to you with something you were expecting from them, a week is a reasonable period of time for a follow-up. When you follow-up, try to add new information instead of just asking "Any updates?"

You always need to be throwing job opportunities into the top of your funnel, even if you feel sure you're about to get an offer. The application process for tech jobs usually takes at least a month, and if all of your farthest applications fall through, you don't want to wait at least a month for something else to land.

Remember that getting rejected from a job doesn't mean getting rejected from the company forever. It's reasonable to reapply again in a couple of months (hopefully with new skills or projects to show), and doing so even demonstrates that you're interested in working for this specific company.
