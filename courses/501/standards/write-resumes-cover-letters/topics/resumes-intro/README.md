# Intro to Resumes

A resume is the document you will be asked for the most in your job search process.

## What a Resume Is

A resume is an advertisement. It's an opportunity to highlight which parts of your background make you especially well-suited for a position.

## What a Resume Is Not

A resume is not a list of everything you've ever done (that's a "Curriciulum Vitae"). It's not a legal document.

## Resume Sections

Here are the most common sections people use in technical resumes:

### Contact Information

Include:

* **Name**
* **A title to describe yourself**. Ideally, this is the same as the title of the job you're applying for. Examples include "Software Engineer", "Software Developer", "Technologist", "Application Engineer", and "Fullstack Developer."
* **City and state or municipality**. This does not necessarily need to be the city you currently live in, but it should be a city you're willing to live in if you get the job. It's usually not necessary to be any more specific than the city.
* **Email address**. Your professional email address should be very straight-forward, and ideally be from a custom domain.
* **Personal website**. Optional. Ideally hosted at a custom domain.
* **Phone number**. Optional.

### Work experience

Jobs, companies, and responsibilities

### Skills

List of your revelant technical skills. Ideally, these match some of the key skills outlined in the job description you're applying for. Three things to leave off:

* Don't include a laundry list of every technology you've ever used; stick with your most relevant, impressive, and strongest skills.
* Don't include skills that are common to any professional. These include things like the Microsoft Office suite, browsers, critical thinking skills, punctuality, teamwork, or communication skills. These things should be inferred by how you handle the application process.
* Don't include skills that are implied by other skills. If you list React, you don't need to also list HTML and CSS. If you list Express, you don't also need to list Node.

Skills should be listed from most to least relevant to the position.

Be extremely careful in how you list a technology. Many common technologies are spelled counterintuitively and inconsistently. A few for reference:

* React
* Express
* Node.js
* Ruby on Rails
* Sass
* Jest
* Cypress
* AWS
* Unix

Always check the official website or documentation to verify spelling.

### Education

List any formal education, including university programs and code schools. In most cases, these should be listed in reverse-chronological order. For each, include:

* **The name of the institution**.
* **The name of the credential you earned**. Be very careful about how you format credentials. While we colloquilliary say "bachelor's degree" and "master's degree," the correct titles are singular and include the discline (e.g. "Master of Arts, English Literature", "Bachelor of Science, Chemistry"). You can also abbreviate the credentials (e.g. "M.A., English Literature", "B.S., Chemistry").
* **The year you earned or will earn the credential**.
* **A list of key subjects studied, memberships, and accomplishments.**

### Accomplishments

Awards, volunteer work, or unique credentials

### Portfolio

A collection of work

## Section Ordering

To be effective as an advertisement for yourself, you should prioritize sections by how impressive they are likely to be to the person reading your resume. Here are some scenarios:

* If you have some relevant technology experience already and some formal education:
  * Contact
  * Work Experience
  * Education
  * Accomplishments
  * Skills
* If you have no technology experience and no formal education and few accomplishments:
  * Contact
  * Portfolio
  * Work Experience
  * Skills
  * Accomplishments

Some principles:

* Always lead with your contact information
* Work experience is usually the most valuable because it represents you delivering value to an organization
* A portfolio is usually used in place of work experience if none exists
* Skills are usually the lowest priority, because they're less concrete than education or accomplishments. If you can include skills in the descriptions of jobs or portfolio items, this section can be omitted.
