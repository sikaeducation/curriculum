# Intro to APIs

When you're building an app that needs data or processing, you have two options:

1. Store the data yourself in a database or write the functionality yourself
2. Get it from someone else

When you get it from someone else, we say that you're getting it from from an "API." API stands for "Application Programming Interface", which is a fairly broad topic in programming. The kinds of APIs we're concerned with are more properly called Web Services.

Let's say we were making an app that allows people to organize their favorite Pokémon. We could add every single Pokémon to a database we own, including names, pictures, abilities, etc. Not only would this be time-consuming, but that also means that every time a new game comes out, we would need to update the database. Luckily, there's a public <a href="https://pokeapi.co" target="_blank">Pokemon API</a> that maintains this for us and allow us to use their data in our applications!

APIs can do more than give us data. They can also do calculations and transform data, like turning text into audio files or identifying the subject  matter of images. Instead of writing all of that functionality yourself, you can integrate these functions into your apps as if you wrote them yourself.

Here are some examples of APIs:

* __Yahoo! Finance__ - View real-time stock prices
* __API Football__ - Check out NFL stats
* __URL Shortener Service__ - Give it a long URL, get back a short URL
* __Skyscanner Flight Search__ - Search flight data and ticket price quotes
* __IBM Watson__ - Use IBM's Supercomputer to do a variety of artificial intelligence tasks
