# JavaScript: Map: Exercises

## Questions

* Describe mapping in your own words
* Indicate whether this means that something should or shouldn't be a map based on the provided data:
  * It returns an array with the same number of values it started with
  * It returns an array with a different number of values than it started with
  * It returns something other than an array
  * It doesn't return anything
  * It changes the original array
  * It returns a transformed version of the original array
  * It starts and ends with an array

## Activities

* `[1, 2, 3]` => `[2, 4, 6]`
* `[1, 2, 3]` => `["1", "2", "3"]`
* `["pikachu", "squirtle", "bulbasaur"]` => `["Pikachu", "Squirtle", "Bulbasaur"]`
* `[{ name: "Pikachu" },{ name: "Squirtle"},{ name: "Bulbasaur" }]` => `["Pikachu", "Squirtle", "Bulbasaur"]`
* `[{ name: "Alice", age: 8 },{ name: "Bill", age: 20 },{ name: "Carol", age: 18}]` => `[{ name: "Alice", age: 8, isAdult: false },{ name: "Bill", age: 20, isAdult: true },{ name: "Carol", age: 18, isAdult: true}]`
* `[{ name: "Pikachu" },{ name: "Squirtle"},{ name: "Bulbasaur" }]` => `[<li>Pikachu</li>, <li>Squirtle</li>, <li>Bulbasaur</li>]` (These are DOM elements)
