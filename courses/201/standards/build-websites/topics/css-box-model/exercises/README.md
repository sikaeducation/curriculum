* When an element has a background color, which parts of the box model will have the background color?
* What's the difference between padding and margin?
* When you want to separate two elements, which box model property should you use?
* When you want to make an element larger, which box model property should you use?
* Where is the border located in the box model?
* What's the difference between width/height and padding?

## Activities


* `width` / `height` - The size of the actual content area, such as the text or image.
* `padding` - The space between the content and the border. If the element has a background color, all of this will be filled in.
* `border` - An optional border separating the padding from the margin
* `margin` - The space between the border and other elements in the document. If the element has a background color, this will  _**not** be filled in.
