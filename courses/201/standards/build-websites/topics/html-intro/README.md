# Introduction to HTML

The primary file type on the web is the HTML document. JavaScript files, stylesheets, media, and other kinds of files we use on the web are made available to users through HTML documents.

When you go to a site on the web with your browser, your browser requests an HTML file and renders it on your screen. The HTML file is a set of instructions for your browser that tell it:

* What content is part of this page? Where should it show up?
* How should this content be described?
* Are there are any images or other media to show?
* Are there any other files needed (like stylesheets) to make to the page work?

## History

HTML was originally designed as a way for researchers to share their research papers with each other. HTML's uses grew to include people sharing content of all kinds with each other, and eventually became a software application platform. This history is why we call HTML pages "documents" and why so much of the syntax on the web is centered around marking up content.
