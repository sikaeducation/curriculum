# Introduction to HTML

The most important file type on the web is the HTML document. JavaScript files, stylesheets, media, and other kinds of files we use on the web are brought into browsers through HTML documents. When you go to a site on the web with your browser, your browser requests an HTML file, and then follows the instructions in it to render it on your screen. HTML files tell your browser:

* What content is part of this page? Where should it show up?
* How should this content be described to machines, search engines, and assistive technologies?
* Are there are any images or other media to show?
* Are there any other files like stylesheets or script files needed to make to the page work?

The code you write in an HTML document answers all these questions.

## History

HTML was originally designed as a way for researchers to share their research papers with each other. HTML's uses grew to include people sharing content of all kinds with each other, and eventually became a software application platform. This history is why we call HTML pages "documents" and why so much of the syntax on the web is centered around marking up content.
