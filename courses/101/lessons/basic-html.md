### Double-Plan

| Student | Instructor |
| --- | --- |
| Open the developer console on a website and inspect the HTML. What do you notice? | Observe what students are looking at |
| Discuss what they saw | Facilitate discussion |
| Take notes | Illustrate single-ended and double-ended HTML tags. Introduce the `<p>` tag. |
| Turns reading the explanation out loud. | Introduce [lorem ipsum](https://www.lipsum.com/). |
| Open an editor, write 3 lorem ipsum paragraphs, display them on a page | Observe, troubleshoot |
| Research and prepare explanation for their topic. | Assign students to research `<p>`, `<label>`, `<input />`, `<output>`, and `<button>` on the [MDN element reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) |
| Present topics, take notes | Facilitate presentations |
| Take notes, think of answer. | Demonstrate labeling an input with `for`/`id`. Ask students to come up with two reasons why it matters (clicking on labels, accessibility).

## Describe HTML

### Double-Plan

| Student | Instructor |
| --- | --- |
| Write a 1 paragraph explanation of what HTML is. | Observe student answers, note things that are especially accurate or inaccurate. |
| Discuss | Facilitate discussion, ask questions that address inaccuracies you noticed. Some useful questions to drive the discussion: What is a markup language? How is different than a programming language? What kinds of things can't be represented with HTML? Why do you need closing tags? Why don't all tags have closing tags? |
