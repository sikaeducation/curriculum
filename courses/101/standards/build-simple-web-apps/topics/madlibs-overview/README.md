# MadLibs Overview

In this workshop, you'll write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive web application.

Check out this example of a [finished MadLibs app]()

## Big Picture

(image goes here)

The content of your application (words, pictures, buttons, inputs, outputs) will be written in a language called HTML. HTML is a way to structure this content in a way that makes it easy to style with CSS and make interactive with JavaScript.

The appearance of the content will be written in a language called CSS. CSS can see your HTML, and it determines how big, small, wide, tall, bold, and colorful to make your content.

The interaction of the application will be written in a language called JavaScript. In our application, JavaScript will read the words people enter into the MadLibs app and put those words into a story and display it on the screen when a button is clicked.
