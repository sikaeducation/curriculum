# MadLibs

This is an exercise that combines basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make a simple web application.

## Instructions

Make an HTML page that includes:

* A title
* A heading
* An area for entering each of the words in the MadLib (hint: use <input> tags)
* A button for submitting the words your user entered
* An area for your MadLibs result (hint: use <span> tags with IDs for all of the words you'll substitute).

Make a CSS page to style your HTML page. Some ideas:

* Change the fonts and other typographic properties
* Make the inputs and labels display on their own lines
* Set the maximum width of long lines to keep them from running across the whole screen
* Change the background color, text color, and border of the button
* Change the style of cursor when hovering over the button
* Modify the padding and margin of different elements to give everything some "breathing room" (remember, this works with the <body> element as well!

Make a JavaScript file that contains a function. Inside of this function:

* Store the values the user enters in the input fields in the HTML page in variables
* Set the text of the relevant <span> elements in the HTML page equal to what you stored in the relevant variable
* Call the function in your JavaScript file from the HTML page when the button is clicked

## Example Mad Lib

Here is an example MadLib that you can use, but feel free to get creative!
