## Why?

Layout is more than looks, it's key to how your users read and understand your content. This is closely related to the semantic meaning of the content- this is an engineering task, not an artistic one.

## Example

This is content without no layout:

Here's the same content with a proper layout:

## What's going on?

Layout establishes the relative importance of things and their relationships with each other. You have a few levers you can pull in a layout to make something more or less important:

| Less Important | More Important |
| --- | --- |
| Lighter | Darker |
| Lower | Higher |
| Desaturated color | Saturated color |
| Left/Right Aligned | Centered |
| Bottom | Top | 
| Right | Left |
| Less whitespace | More whitespace |

You also have a few levers you can pull to show the relationship between things:

| Less Related | More Related |
| --- | --- |
| Different color | Same color |
| Different size | Same size |
| Farther | Closer |

## Gotchas

* Everything can't be equally important, and everything can't have the same relationship with each other
* Don't over-center
* Putting something too close to an edge creates tension

## History

Layouts started as a print consideration, going all the way back to bibles. The margins on a book are so your thumbs have somewhere to go. Web layout has changed considerably as the web has migrated from research documents to mobile applications.
