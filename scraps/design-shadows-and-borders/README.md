# Shadows and Borders

Shadows and borders can add a lot to your design, but they're also easy to use incorrectly.

## Borders

Borders can help group related content:

(example)

A border has 3 main elements:

* Width
* Style
* Color

Additionally, a border can have square or radiused corners:

(example)

Lastly, a border can be on every side of an element or only on some:

(example)

Borders are great for:

* Cards
* Inputs

## Shadows

Shadows give an element dimension and make it feel like its sitting on top of or beneath other elements.

Some guidelines:

* An element with a shadow can be far away from other elements or very close
* Things that are close cast hard shadows, things that are far away cast soft shadows

(example)

* Shadows are created by a light source. The light source on a page should stay consistent- if the light source is coming from the top, the shadows should generally be cast below elements

(bad example)
(good example)

* Using the opposite shadow from the light source makes something look inset:

(example)

## Watch Out

* One of the most common design mistakes is to overuse borders:

(example)

This is akin to explaining a joke. Using whitespace and grouping is a better choice most of the time:

(example)

* Another common design mistake is to only use black shadows. You can use lighter greys and even mix in colors to make them appear more natural:

(example)

* Both shadows and borders work better with subtlety:

(bad example)
(good example)

## History

Flat design generally eschews shadows in favor of things that create the impression of dimension with simpler elements:

(example)

Shadows became much more popular in web design with the advent of Google's Material Design, which prioritizes physicality, motion, texture, and dimension.
