## Why?

Semantic markup is describing what something _is_ rather than what it _looks like_.

* Robots
* Easier to style
* Easier to read
* Accessible

The syntax is computer-validatable, but the semantics are more interpretive.

## Example

This is valid HTML, but is wrong:

```html
```

This is what it should look like:

```html
```

## What's going on

There are a little fewer than 150 HTML tags. Some of them are used way more than others:

A couple of them have special functionality:

* Media tags
* Form tags

The rest of them are mostly generic, although they're given a default appearance by your browser.

## Watch Out!

* Some elements have a semantic meaning that's counter to how they're commonly styled
* Sometimes how something is styled is closely related to how its marked up because of the same invisible structure behind it
* Sometimes you do need to add wrappers
