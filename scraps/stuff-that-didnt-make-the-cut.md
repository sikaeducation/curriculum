// Input: Any string of words with/without punctuation.
// Output: A scrambled form of the same sentence but with the word's first and last
//   letter's positions intact.

var myString = "According to a research team at Cambridge University, it doesn't matter in what order the letters in a word are, the only important thing is that the first and last letter be in the right place. The rest can be a total mess and you can still read it without a problem. This is because the human mind does not read every letter by itself, but the word as a whole. Such a condition is appropriately called Typoglycemia.";

# Suck Less at Networking

Networking is important for people in the tech industry to keep up with new trends, establish connections to find your next job, and to make friends. Networking events can be stressful, though, if you don’t have a plan. 

During this workshop, we’ll help you craft a plan for your next networking event, including how to work the room by initiating conversations with new people, and how to talk about yourself and your journey in tech. 

Hook:

## Why does networking matter?

No matter how talented you are, you can get more done through other people. Networks expand what you’re capable of doing. The real power of a network doesn't even come from the people you know- you get included in their network also, which gives everyone exponentially more access to more people. 

## Objectives

By the end of this end of the lesson, you will be able to:

* Demonstrate a “Hi! IQ” Introduction 
* Demonstrate how to help somebody in a networking conversation
* Demonstrate an actionable close to a networking conversation

## Hi! IQ Introductions

Demonstrate it for the students

A Hi! IQ intro includes:

1. Say "hi!" 
2. Introduce yourself
    * 1-2 sentences
3. Ask the other person a question

Question Suggestions:

* What do you do?
* What was the best talk you saw today? 
* How did you hear about this event? 
* What is the most interesting part of your job? 
* What would you recommend? 
* What resources do you recommend to learn more about what you do? 
* I’m new here, what are some restaurants you’d recommend?

Ask open-ended questions that let the person talk about themselves.

## Demonstrate how to help somebody in a networking conversation

Networking needs to be a 2-way street. No one wants to give you access to their network if you don't have anything to offer. Luckily, there are a lot of ways you can help people:

* Make an introduction 
* Offer to help 
    * Beta test a production
    * Find someone for them
* Offer to teach someone something you know
* Make a suggestion
    * Meetup
    * Learning Tool
    * Company 
* Feedback 
    * Resume
    * Portfolio
    * Github

Practice with someone saying:

* I’m a recent graduate of GA and I’m having trouble getting job interviews
* I’m the founder of a small startup, and I’m struggling to hire devops people 
* I’m a mid-level dev and I’m happy at my job, but I’m really curious about <insert new technology here> 
* I just moved to here for a job and I really like Denver. But I had a big network back home and now I feel like I'm starting from scratch.

## Demonstrate an actionable close to a networking conversation

How do you end a conversation so you move on to the next talk and let them move on to theirs? This has two steps:

1. Express gratitude for their time
2. Commit to an action

Examples: 

"It was nice to meet you."

* "Can I add you on LinkedIn?"
* "I'm going to send you a message on Slack right now, let's catch up tomorrow"
* "Let's catch up at that talk next week!"

## Questions

### Where do you draw the line between passing in a whole object versus a series of props?

There's no science to this, but here are some ideas:

* If all of the props are part of the same thing and there are 3 or less of them, I'd probably pass them in individually
* If all of the props are part of the same thing and there are 4 or more, I'd probably just pass in an object
* If any of the props are part of different things, I'd consider grouping at least one of them in an object

The practical concern is that when you pass in something as an object, you have to either alias the property you want to use in a computed property or do {{ someObject.someProperty }} all over the template. You lose some of the type warnings if you just pass in an object for everything, all the time. On the other hand, passing in 8 props to a component can make it hard to understand at a macro-level what's actually being given to it.

# User Registration

Create an Express HTTP server that contains middleware to handle `POST /users` requests with `username` and `password` key-value pairs in the request body. Ensure the middleware takes the following steps.

1. Generate a `hashed_password` using the bcrypt cryptographic hash function.
2. Insert the `username` and `hashed_password` into a `users` table.
3. Respond with just a `200` status code on successful insertion into the table.

Be sure to pass along any errors to the error handling middleware in the stack. For good measure, include a `404` catch-all middleware in the stack as well.

As a bonus, ensure the middleware takes the following steps.

- Respond with a `400` status code if either the `username` or `password` is blank.
- Respond with a `400` status code if a row with the same `username` already exists in the `users` table.

---

Using the [Express HTTP server](../User Registration/), add two new route handlers to the middleware stack for logging users in and out.

First, add middleware to handle `POST /session` requests with username and password key-value pairs in the request body. Ensure this middleware takes the following steps.

- If a row with the username doesn't exists in the `users` table, respond with just a 401 status code.
- Use bcrypt to see if the password from the request matches the `hashed_password` from the selected user row.
- If the passwords don't match, respond with just a 401 status code.
- If the passwords do match, store the user's `id` in the session and respond with just a 200 status code.

Be sure to pass along any errors to the error handling middleware in the stack. For good measure, include a 404 catch-all middleware in the stack as well.

As a bonus, ensure this middleware takes the following steps.

- Respond with a 400 status code if either the username or password is blank.

Then, add middleware to handle `DELETE /session` requests. Ensure this middleware takes the following steps.

- Destroy the session.
- Respond with just a 200 status code.

---

For today’s warmup, your goal is to refactor your error handling middleware to render an error template.

- Create a new template in the views directory called `error.ejs`
- Change your `404` and `500` error handlers to render `error.ejs` with information from the error object. (err.message, err.status, err.stack, etc.)
- Use Materialize to style the page however you’d like, think of [GitHub’s 404 page](https://github.com/404) for inspiration.

Your refactored error handlers could look like this:

```js
app.use(function(_req, res, next) {
  var err = new Error('Not Found');
  err.status = 404;
  next(err);
});

app.use(function(err, _req, res, _next) {
    res.status(err.status || 500);
    res.render('error', {
      message: err.message,
      error: err
    });
  });
```

---

# Express Static Server

Today's morning warmup has two parts.

In a `server.js` file, implement an Express server that serves the following `index.html` page as a static file.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Index</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h2>Index</h2>
  </body>
</html>
```

http://expressjs.com/en/api.html#express.static
http://expressjs.com/en/starter/static-files.html

Then, in the same file, add a `404` catch all middleware that serves the following `404.html` page as a sent file.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>404 Not Found</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h2>404 Not Found</h2>
  </body>
</html>
```

http://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res.sendFile

Given the pokemon_list data set, in a `server.js` file, implement an Express server that renders the following `index.ejs` template when visiting `localhost:8000/pokemon`.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>All Pokemon</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <td>Sprite</td>
          <td>Name</td>
          <td>Pokedex Number</td>

    </table>
  </body>
</html>
```

http://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-template-engines.html

Hint: You’ll want to use a templating engine called EJS
https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs

Then, in the same file, render a different `profile.ejs` template when visiting `localhost:8000/pokemon/:id`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

# We're All Hackers!

Hacking is about finding vulnerabilities in software. As engineers, our duty to our users and our companies is to be anti-hackers. In order to prevent breaches, we must understand breaches. This warmup is about a well known vulnerability in JavaScript.

Do not change the code of `server.js` for this warmup.

You do need to `npm install` and `nodemon server.js`.

## Step 1: Understand the code

`server.js` is a very simple web-server with a very large security flaw. First try running the server and reading the code. Decide what this server is meant to do, and understand how it works. Once you understand the intent, understand how it's working. If you encounter code you have not seen before, or are having trouble understanding use the internet, or write another small scratch program to test the code you don't understand.

## Step 2: Identify the flaw

There is exactly one line of code that opens up the security risk in this example. Which line is it? Why is it dangerous?

## Step 3: Exploit

Now that you know where the flaw is, how could we exploit it? Try do cause the webserver to do the following things __without changing the code in `server.js`__:

1. Kill the server. You might be able to do this by causing an error, or you might need to be more clever. Try googling: "exit a node js process".
1. Send a GET request that causes the information in secretText.txt to be sent to the browser.
1. Send a GET request that causes the information in secretText.txt to change.

With this particular exploit, the possibilities for what CAN be done are essentially limitless. For an extra special bonus, try to send a GET request that causes a new route to be registered on `server.js` without restarting the server!

```js
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

// var fs = require('fs');var secret = fs.readFileSync('./secretText.txt'); res.send(secret.toString());return;

// var fs = require('fs');var secret = fs.writeFileSync('./secretText.txt', 'all your base are belong to me -- root');

app.get('/', function(req, res){
    res.send("HELLO WORLD!");
});
// /add/process.exit()/2
app.get('/:operation/:x/:y', function(req, res){
    var operators = {
        add: "+",
        sub: "-",
        mult: "*",
        div: "/"
    }
    var operator = operators[req.params.operation]

    try {
      var result = eval(req.params.x + operator + req.params.y);
      res.send(result.toString());
    }
    catch(error) {
      res.send(error);
    }

});

app.listen(3000, function(){
    console.log("STARTING SERVER ON 3000");
});


// /add/process.exit();
```

```
all your base are belong to me -- root
```

Ensure all primary and foreign keys have an index. Rememember to drop any existing tables from the database before creating new ones.

Once you're satisfied, feel free to add more columns to either table as you see fit.

# SQL Seeds

Using SQL, build a seed file for the following database tables.

| id | name                          | price |
|----|-------------------------------|-------|
| 1  | Capitol Hill Block Party 2016 | 49.99 |
| 2  | Bumbershoot 2016              | 64.99 |

| id | concert_id | name            | age |
|----|------------|-----------------|-----|
| 1  | 1          | Daniel Bailey   | 52  |
| 2  | 1          | Heidi McGuire   | 30  |
| 3  | 2          | Corey Reyes     | 26  |
| 4  | 2          | Kristi Sheridan | 45  |

Remember to delete all the existing rows from each table before inserting new ones.

Once you're satisfied, feel free to insert more rows to either table as you see fit.

### MVC

Find an instructor to interview you about MVC and ask you the following questions:

* What is MVC?
* What are the responsibilities of the different parts of MVC?
* How do the parts of MVC interact with each other?
* How would you break up Reddit into the MVC pattern?
* Describe MVC in relation to a front-end framework of your choice
* How do components relate to MVC?
* Look at this example in the fictional xKYLEx MVC framework:

```
const favoriteColors = ["Blue", "Yellow", "Red", "Magenta"];

<some-component>
    {{#each favoriteColors as color}}
        <li>{{color}}</li>
    {{/each}}
    <form>
        <input type="text" model="currentColor" />
        <input type="submit" value="Add Color" />
    </form>
</some-component>

let currentColor = "";

function addColor(){
    favoriteColors.push(currentColor);
}

someComponent.on("submit", addColor);
window.on("load", renderSomeComponent);
```

Discuss how the above example uses MVC.
